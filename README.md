# Raspberry Smart GreenHouse ðŸŒ»
A project to build a smart greenhouse using raspberry pi3 (all version of raspberry pi are good adjust only pins of input/output and its ok). 
The project is for a triennal thesis of Informatic engeneering from University of Bergamo (UniBG)

to control all the physical aspects of interest for growing plants.
