# Raspberry Smart GreenHouse ðŸŒ»
A project to build a smart greenhouse using raspberry pi3 (all version of raspberry pi are good adjust only pins of input/output and its ok). 
The project is for a triennal thesis of Informatic engeneering from University of Bergamo (UniBG)
The idea was to build a structure isolated from the outside and, through sensors connected to a simple computer (in this case a raspberry), 
to control all the physical aspects of interest for growing plants.
in the repository you will find, in addition to the python script, also the flowcharts and the connections made.
The file representing the thesis itself will also be available for those interested in reading it.
